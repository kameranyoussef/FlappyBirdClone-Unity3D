This project is a Flappy Bird Clone in Unity3D using C#. Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game where the player controls a bird that flies through gaps between pipes. The goal is to avoid hitting the pipes and score as many points as possible. This clone replicates the gameplay, graphics and sound effects of the original game using Unity3D, a cross-platform game engine. The code is written in C#, a general-purpose programming language that is widely used for game development. The project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates how to use Unity3D features such as sprites, animations, physics, audio and user interface.
